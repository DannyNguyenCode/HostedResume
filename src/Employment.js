                    Customer Service Representative
                  </h2>
                  <p className='card-text'>
                    As a customer service representative, we were in constant
                    contact with the customers, whether it was by phone, mobile,
                    drive-thru, or face-to-face. We worked as a unit, rotation
                    between stations in preparing the incredients, producing the
                    product, and serving the product to the customer. In
                    preparing the ingredients, we would handle the delivery and
                    stock up the stations. When producing the product we would
                    bake the pasteries, make the sandwiches, and make the
                    beverages to be handed off to the person in charge of
                    delivering the order to the customer. When delivering the
                    order to the customer, we would receive the payment, whether
                    it is by cash, debit, or credit, and hand over the order to
                    the customer in a satisfactory manner, which means if the
                    order had two or more drinks, a tray would be used. We also
                    had to implement new methods of how customers ordered. In my
                    time working, we had just implemented mobile ordering
                    through the Tim Horton's app and kiosks within the
                    restaurant. Incorporating these new methods required
                    multi-tasking and an ability to quickly adapt because they
                    are vital to retaining/attracting customers.
